## Mission Statement
LASA Bowls of Hope is a student run organization whose goal is to help give back to the local and global community through food drives and fundraisers. Bowls of Hope was founded with the purpose of helping LASA students do their part in ending world hunger. We host multiple student run food drives and fundraisers throughout the year, working to raise food and money for organisations like the Central Texas Food Bank and the Indian Foodbanking Network. 

## How to Join
Our club has a very relaxed environment. You can "join" the club with no commitment to participate in any of our events. To join, fill out our form at https://goo.gl/forms/boJ8XD8igS3LoycG3. This will add you to our email list so you can learn about upcoming volunteer opporunities to help prevent hunger in Central Texas and other special events like our food drive.
