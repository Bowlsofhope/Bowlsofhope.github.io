## Mission Statement
LASA Bowls of Hope is a student run organization whose goal is to help give back to the local and global community through food drives and fundraisers. Bowls of Hope was founded with the purpose of helping LASA students do their part in ending world hunger. We host multiple student run food drives and fundraisers throughout the year, working to raise food and money for organisations like the Central Texas Food Bank and the Indian Foodbanking Network.
