Hi everyone. In case you haven’t heard, we’re hosting a food drive from April 15th (Wednesday) to May 2nd (Saturday)!

Getting healthy food is one of the many worries of our Central Texas neighbors in normal times, and that’s without a pandemic! [This CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/politics/food-banks-supplies-groceries-coronavirus/index.html) has some more specifics about why it is important to help out food drives during this global crisis.

You can help by donating food to our food drive, in which the food will be donated to the Central Texas Food Bank. If you don’t have food to donate, you can also [volunteer at the Central Texas Food Bank in a safe manner](https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/get-involved/volunteer), or [donate money directly to them](https://secure3.convio.net/cafbtx/site/Donation2;jsessionid=00000000.app30101a?18029.donation=form1&df_id=18029&mfc_pref=T&NONCE_TOKEN=0CBD2EB4FD8D0346990F0D14BCE8C1DF) (they’re a really great nonprofit).

On the porch of each house, there will be a box that you can drop off items in. You can drop off items anytime, during the dates of the food drive (**April 15th (Wednesday) to May 2nd (Saturday)**)

# Safety Instructions
