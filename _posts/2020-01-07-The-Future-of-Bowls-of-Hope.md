I'm creating the rare post on this website. For the information of anybody that reads this, I'm thinking of not renewing this club next year, in 2020/2021.

## Why?
Simply because no one seems to be active in this club. I joined/was a founder of it because at the beginning, we had 40+ people at each meeting, 40+ people that seemed to participate fully. Yet that number has exponentially decreased until now, where a few meandering souls will come to each volunteering opportunity.

## How you could change this
This isn't some kind of advertisement. If you would like to "take over" the club, including the email list, website, logo, etc. then email me (<samchristian.2727@gmail.com>) and I'll give it to you. It's as simple as that! Underclassmen preferred
