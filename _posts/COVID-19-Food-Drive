Hi everyone. In case you haven’t heard, we’re hosting a food drive!

Getting healthy food is one of the many worries of our Central Texas neighbors in normal times, and that’s without a pandemic! [This CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/politics/food-banks-supplies-groceries-coronavirus/index.html) has some more specifics about why it is important to help out food drives during this global crisis.

You can help by donating food to our food drive, in which the food will be donated to the Central Texas Food Bank. If you don’t have food to donate, you can also [volunteer at the Central Texas Food Bank in a safe manner](https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/get-involved/volunteer), or [donate money directly to them](https://secure3.convio.net/cafbtx/site/Donation2;jsessionid=00000000.app30101a?18029.donation=form1&df_id=18029&mfc_pref=T&NONCE_TOKEN=0CBD2EB4FD8D0346990F0D14BCE8C1DF) (they’re a really great nonprofit).

What items to drop off
We can only accept non-perishable food.
The most needed items, according to the Central Texas Food Bank, are:
peanut butter 
canned chicken breast or tuna 
canned low sodium vegetables canned fruit in its own juice (no sugar added) 
dry pinto beans 
brown rice 
non-fat dry milk powder 
100% whole grain cereal
All non-perishable items will be accepted though.

Where to drop off items
You can drop off items at any of the locations below:
* 8108 Tierra Linda Ln
* 10502 floral park dr
* 12224 Tanglewild Drive
* 2108 Wright St.

On the porch of each house, there will be a box that you can drop off items in. You can drop off items anytime, during the dates of the food drive (April 15th (Wednesday) to May 2nd (Saturday))

As you should be doing at all times, avoid contact with other people when dropping off food (staying six feet away at least). If you’re feeling sick or have had contact with someone that you know is sick, please don’t drop off food.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to email us: us@bowlsofhope.org

Thanks for reading this important information document and we look forward to seeing your donation!
