Bowls of Hope, in partnership with the Central Texas Food Bank, provides occasional volunteering opportunities. These are filled on a first come, first serve basis, and due to the popularity of volunteering at the Central Texas Food Bank, we typically only are able to reserve a small number of spots.

These volunteering opportunities will be emailed to club memebrs. If you want to join, please fill out the form on the "about" page.

Any questions can be directed to bowlsofhope@gmail.com, or contact one of us in person/at school.
